VERSION 1 - PRELIMINAY WORK

01.10.19 - First anaylsis and code

	Sebastien Mallet is used to work with CSV iRacing Race Results and to make
	some statistics on it because of iPitting.

	Free time was spent to understand the current splitting process, mostly
	in Special Events. Code writting to retro engineering current algorithm
	is a great help to understand it.

	Some first simple ideas come after that after analysis of car class distribution
	and iRating distribution.


17.10.19 - Better Splits for iRacing initiative

	Sebastien Mallet launched a forum topic: http://board.ipitting.com/bettersplits
	A short video trailer is in it to try something funny and viral https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTahIag-TCU
	It was share by some teams on social networks :)
	
	And a more interresting presentation is available here :
		English : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBjtvHCp0LE
		French : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FQWK9_npBk

	To present two first ideas :
		- Different car class distribution compared:
			- Egalitarian: the current one (15/15/16)
			- Proportionnal : what was in iRating before 2015 Season 4 
			- Balanced : something in the middle

		- iRacing Threshold: a first (very simple) idea to not mix driver up and down an iRacing limit.

	The forum topic was a great starting point to discuss and exchange ideas around that.



IMPORTANT FEEDBACKS BETWEEN V1 AND V2

	17.10.19 - Scott McIntyre - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3669811.page#11766624
	Idea of moving down lesspopulated classes splits by matching the SoF of the most populated one.

	17.10.19 - Yannick Lapchin - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3669811.page#11766644
	Top split and broadcast: need a way to have all categories on top split if needed.

	18.10.19 - Yannick Lapchin - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/25/3669811.page#11766963
	SoF difference problem is relative to iRating level: Less problem between 4.5k GTE and 3.0k DP than between 3.0 GTE and 2.0 DP.
	
	18.10.19 - Sebastien Mallet - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/25/3669811.page#11766986
	React about Scott's ideas and how it can be implemented. (draft PDF attached to understand algorithm)

	21.10.19 - Sebastien Mallet - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/50/3669811.page#11769306
	First preview of a draft of a "move down algorithm, based on Balanced car class distribution.

	21.10.19 - Sebastien Mallet - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/50/3669811.page#11769652
	Speaking about two options : 'no move down' in top split VS relative % allowed SoF difference relative to split SoF. (affine function)

	21.10.19 - Yannick Lapchin - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/75/3669811.page#11769692
	About Balanced car class distribution : clues to improve it. 
	For example in Petit Le Mans, when 3 car classes, it should looks like 12 / 13 / 20 cars
	and when 2 classes it should looks like 17 / 28.

	23.10.19 - Yannick Lapchin - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/75/3669811.page#11771352
	Details and formula of the Affine function to distribute cars.
	Allows to implement a 'min cars' parameter which will set the minimum cars we can have in a split class.

	24.10.19 - Sebastien Mallet - https://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/75/3669811.page#11772161
	New "SmartMoveDown Predicted Affine Distribution". Implements a prediction of all the SoF changes 
	infered by the MoveDown, before doing it for real. The MoveDown is tested if the new situation
	gives less diffrences between SoF. This method is better than before, where we act a MoveDown
	only when difference BEFORE THE MORE where higher than a Δ parameter.
